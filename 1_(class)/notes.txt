+ Classes is an evolution of structs, it is possible to have attributes and methods, public and private.

Start class:
class <class_name> {

};

* Set public/private:
class <class_name>{
    private:
        (...) //generally declare attributes.
    public:
        (...) //constructor/destructor gets/sets
}


* Define Constructor/Destructor: It will have the same name as the class, there will be no return, you can use methods from the class itself.
class <class_name>{
    (...)
    public:
        <class_name>(attributes){
            (...) //generally gives the value of the attributes.
        }
        ~<class_name>(){
            (...) //generally empty, used when doing dynamic allocation within the class.
        }
}
// NOTE: I can create several constructors, as long as each one differs in attributes, so it is possible to start a class in different ways, depending on the attributes passed at initialization.
// NOTE2: I can initialize the constructor in other way:
// -<name_class>(int dd, int mm, int yy) : d{dd}, m{mm}, y{yy} { }
// -<name_class>(int dd, int mm, int yy){d=dd; m=mm; y=yy;}                  //(same).


* Define methods outside the class: it is necessary to initialize them inside the class (<func_type> <func_name>(attributes);), and then assign them outside ( <func_type> <class_name>::<func_name>(attributes){} )
class <class_name>{
    (...)
    public:
        <class_name>(attributes); //I can do the same with constructors and destructors.
        <type1> <class_name1>(attributes);
        <type2> <class_name2>(attributes);
}
<class_name>::<class_name>(attributes){} //constructor
<func_type1> <class_name>::<func_name1>(attributes){}
<func_type2> <class_name>::<func_name2>(attributes){}


- Classes are a new user-defined type, containing 'characteristics' (attributes) and 'behaviors' (methods).
- Objects are instances of a given class.
ex class/object: Class: Item / Object: sword.


- Classes:
-- It is a user-defined type.
-- Set of attributes (values) and methods (functions).
-- Constructors, responsible for initializing the class and Destructors, responsible for finishing and cleaning.
-- Members of a class are accessed through a "." for variables and a "->" for pointers.
-- public members can be accessed inside and outside the class implementation, private members can only be accessed inside the class.
-- note: struct is like a class in which all its members are public.


- CONCEPT: Encapsulation = when we encapsulate certain attributes or methods of a class (through private) so that the user cannot interact with it.


- remember, when you pass an parameter as const, he will never be changeble inside the funciton.
--OBS: i can define a FUNCTION as a CONST, in this way it will never change the variables that surround them (GREAT FOR GETS FUNCTIONS)
---ex  --->  void get_day() const {return day;}
---When i want to change an variable inside an const function, when i declare this variable it has to have "multable" (ex: mutable int count;) //this way i can change this variable everywhere.
--OBS2: i can define an OBJECT as CONST this way, when i declare an OBJECT Const its attributes will neer chenge.
--ex  --->  const Date birthday(10, 8, 2003)


- STATIC: used to create variables/functions of a class that can be used by all objects in the class (at the same time).
--To create a static variable/func simply apply the name "static" before declaring the var/func type. (the class is created private like any other, thus having its get/set also static)
--if I change its value in any object, it will change in all of them.
--static variables in a class belonging to class and not objects.
--To call a static variable, because it belongs to the class and not the object, it is called as follows: <class_name>::<static_name> -> Class::count -> Class::count()
--They can be called by the object itself as well: <object>.count -> <object>.count()


-THIS: is a c++ keyword in which it is an implicit pointer that points to the current object that is calling a method or function.


-CONCEPT : Class Composition = a class can be composed of other classes.
--Composition is a way of establishing relationships between classes, where a class "owns" or "contains" objects from other classes as its data members.
--Composition is useful for creating complex objects by breaking functionality into smaller, reusable parts, improving code modularity and maintainability.
