+ Replaces stdio.h for IOSTTREAM

+ iostram: (io = input/output) used to receive information or give information to the user via the stream.
Note: it is necessary to use the prefix std::

cout = printf (use << )
cin = scanf ( use >> )

-- Tips to remember:

- using namespace std; //this way is no longer necessary to use the prefix std:: in the iostram functions
- std::endl; // similar to "\n"
- #define var value; // to define the constant

ceil = round UP a value ex: ceil(1.3) //2
floor = round down a value ex: floor(1.3) //1
pow = power a number by another ex: pow(2, 3) //8
