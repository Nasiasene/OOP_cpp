Banking Control System with Operations
 
Description:
You have been hired to develop a banking control system for a financial institution.
The system must allow the management of bank accounts, withdrawals, deposits, operations and reports.
Create classes that represent each of these entities and explore programming concepts
object-oriented like:
    - class declaration, object instantiation
    - access and modification methods (gets and sets)
    - object arrays
    - constructor and destructor methods
    - use of dynamically allocated attributes
    - different types of composition
 
Requirements:
 
Create a Customer class that contains information about the bank's customers, such as name, CPF and address.
Create an Operation class that represents the operations carried out on the accounts. Each operation must have a type (withdrawal or deposit) and an associated value.
Create an Account class that represents bank accounts. Each account must have an account number, an associated customer, a balance and a list of operations carried out.
Create a Bank class that manages bank accounts. The class must contain a dynamic array of accounts, allowing accounts to be added and removed dynamically.
 
Define relationships between classes using different types of composition.
 
Implement methods to create accounts, make deposits, withdrawals, display statements and account reports in the system.
 
Use constructor methods to initialize objects and destructor methods to free dynamically allocated memory.
 
Create a test function that demonstrates the creation and use of the classes, including creating customers, bank accounts, bank transactions, and bank management actions.
